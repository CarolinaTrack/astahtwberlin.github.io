  code\nIntroduction\nIn this tutorial we’ll create a few blog posts and list them
  on our demo Bakery Store site.\n\nCreating a post\nBlog posts live in the _posts
  directory. Each post is stored in its own file. The file name of a post is important,
  the beginning has the date when the post was or will be published, then there’s
  a title and finally an extension. By default, blog posts are commonly written in
  Markdown but can also be written in HTML. We’ll create a new file for our first
  post: _posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md.\n\nIn our post we’ll start with
  empty front matter. We need this empty front matter to tell Jekyll that this isn’t
  a static file. Then we’ll add our Markdown content:\n\n---\n---\nThe chocolate chip
  cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman,
  Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s.
  Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by
  M. Barrows &amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first
  to include the recipe \"Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie\" which rapidly became
  a favorite cookie in American homes.\n\nSource / Read more [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie)\nWe’ll
  repeat this for another post, _posts/2016-04-04-sourdough-bread.md:\n\n---\n---\nSourdough
  bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli
  and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made
  with baker's yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due
  to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.\n\nSource / Read more [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough)\nList
  all posts\nWe have two blog posts on our site, let’s have a page which lists all
  the posts. We’ll create blog.html in the root of the site and add front matter to
  set the layout and title:\n\n---\nlayout: page\ntitle: Blog Page\n---\nNext we’ll
  output the blog posts in an unordered list, each post will have a link and title.
  Jekyll gives us access to an array of all the posts at site.posts. A post object
  has special properties. url is the URL for the generated post page, date is (by
  default) the date specified in the file name and title is (by default) the title
  specified in the file name:\n\n...\n<ul>\n  {% for post in site.posts %}\n    <li><a
  href=\"{{ post.url }}\">{{ post.title }}</a></li>\n  {% endfor %}\n</ul>\nBlog posts\n\nWhen
  we click on a post it takes us to the generated page:\n\nBlog post\n\nPost layout\nThe
  generated page currently has no styling because there’s no layout. Let’s create
  a layout at _layouts/posts.html, inherit the page layout then output the title,
  date and content. Jekyll automatically converts the markdown content into HTML:\n\n---\nlayout:
  page\n---\n\n<h2 class=\"spacing\">{{ page.title }}</h2>\n<p>{{ page.date }}</p>\n\n{{
  content }}\nNow we need to add the layout in _posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md
  and _posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md.\n\n---\nlayout: posts\n---\n...\nFormatted
  blog post\n\nDate filter\nThat’s almost there except the date is too long. We can
  run it through a date filter to fix the formatting:\n\n...\n<p>{{ page.date | date:
  '%B %d, %Y' }}</p>\n...\nDate\n\nShare with:\nWhat's next?\nContinue Learning\nIntroduction
